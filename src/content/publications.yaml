  tldr: "The single most valuable lesson from the success of LLM is that scaling works. Before we are carried away by all the fancy current techniques of RL finetuning (e.g. Deepseek R1), RAG, or inference-time compute, the scaling of data is the single most important thing for RFM to gain rookie-level capabilities."
