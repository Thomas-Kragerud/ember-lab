Our autonomous racing research focuses on developing algorithms that enable vehicles to navigate complex tracks at high speeds, often at the limits of friction and control. This research area combines optimal control theory, machine learning, and vehicle dynamics to create racing systems that can outperform human drivers.

## Research Challenges

- **Model predictive control at the limits**: Developing control algorithms that can handle the nonlinear dynamics of vehicles operating at the friction limits
- **Adversarial learning for robust control**: Creating policies that are robust to variations in track conditions, vehicle parameters, and disturbances
- **Multi-agent racing strategies**: Enabling vehicles to make strategic decisions when competing against other autonomous or human-driven vehicles
- **Sim-to-real transfer**: Bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance for high-speed racing scenarios

Our lab has developed a novel framework called DiAL-MPC (Dynamic Adversarial Learning for Model Predictive Control) that combines the strengths of model-based control with learning-based approaches. This approach has led to significant improvements in racing performance across a variety of track configurations.

We collaborate closely with industry partners and regularly participate in autonomous racing competitions, including the CES AI Racing League and the Indy Autonomous Challenge, where our algorithms have consistently achieved top performances.
