Self-play reinforcement learning allows robotic systems to evolve sophisticated behaviors by competing against themselves or previous versions. This approach has led to breakthrough results in complex domains like game playing (AlphaGo, OpenAI Five) and we're extending these techniques to physical robotics problems.

## Key Research Areas

- **Multi-agent competition**: Developing frameworks where multiple agents can compete and collaboratively improve their policies
- **Curriculum learning through self-play**: Creating progressively more challenging scenarios as the agent improves
- **Emergent behaviors**: Studying the unexpected strategies and behaviors that emerge from self-play training
- **Transfer to real robots**: Ensuring that behaviors learned in simulation transfer effectively to physical systems

Our recent work has shown that self-play can be particularly effective for tasks where the optimal behavior is difficult to specify through traditional reward engineering. By allowing the system to discover its own solutions through competitive optimization, we can achieve more robust and adaptive behaviors.

We apply these techniques to a range of robotic applications, from dexterous manipulation to multi-robot coordination problems, advancing the frontiers of autonomous learning systems.
