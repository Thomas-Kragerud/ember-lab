Our research in robotic manipulation focuses on developing algorithms and systems that allow robots to interact with objects in their environment with human-like dexterity. We work on both grasping and in-hand manipulation, with a focus on generalizable skills that can be applied to a wide range of objects and tasks.

## Research Directions

- **Learning from demonstration**: Developing techniques for robots to learn manipulation skills from human demonstrations
- **Tactile sensing**: Integrating rich tactile feedback to enable more precise and adaptive manipulation
- **Multi-fingered control**: Creating control algorithms for complex, multi-fingered robotic hands
- **Visual-tactile integration**: Combining visual and tactile information for robust perception during manipulation tasks

One key aspect of our approach is combining model-based control techniques with learning-based methods. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage physical intuition while still capturing the complexity of contact dynamics during manipulation.

Our lab is equipped with several robotic manipulators, including custom-designed hands and commercially available systems. We test our algorithms on a wide range of everyday objects, working toward general-purpose manipulation capabilities that can support applications from manufacturing to assistive robotics.
