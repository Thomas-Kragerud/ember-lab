In order to use the news section, add one of the example .md files into the news folder.
If there are no news files in the folder, the news section will not be shown on the homepage.

A news entry is simply a Markdown file with some additional fields. These fields are placed in the Frontmatter — the section at the top of the file enclosed by three dashes (---). They are required for Astro to parse the file and enable website functionality.

Example:
---
slug: "robotics-frontiers-partnership"
title: "EMBER Lab Launches Industry Partnership with Robotics Frontiers Inc."
date: "2023-10-12"
summary: "Our lab has established a 3-year research partnership with Robotics Frontiers Inc. to develop next-generation collaborative robots for manufacturing."
---

The Frontmatter contains metadata like the slug, which must be a unique identifier for the article.
title and summary are shown in the small version of the news card on the homepage.
The rest of the file — the Markdown content below the Frontmatter — is what gets displayed when the user clicks into the full news article.
