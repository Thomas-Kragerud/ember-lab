*The project will leverage our lab's expertise in reinforcement learning and tactile sensing*

## Research Objectives

This grant will support our team's efforts to develop:

1. **Novel Tactile Sensors**
   - High-resolution force distribution mapping
   - Integration with compliant grippers
   - Low-cost, robust design for practical deployment

2. **Multi-Modal Learning Frameworks**
   - Vision-touch integrated perception
   - Self-supervised representation learning
   - Few-shot adaptation to new objects

3. **Real-World Deployment**
   - Household assistance tasks
   - Warehouse automation applications
   - Human-robot collaborative manipulation

### Project Team

The interdisciplinary research team includes:

- **Principal Investigator**: Prof. Sarah Chen, EMBER Lab Director
