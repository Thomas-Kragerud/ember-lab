*The partnership will focus on developing robots that can work safely alongside human workers in complex manufacturing environments*

## Research Focus Areas

The collaboration will target three key technical challenges:

1. **Adaptive Manufacturing**
   - Real-time adaptation to product variations
   - Learning from demonstration for quick reprogramming
   - Quality control through multi-modal sensing

2. **Safe Human-Robot Collaboration**
   - Advanced proximity sensing and prediction
   - Variable impedance control for safety
   - Intuitive interfaces for non-experts

3. **System Integration**
   - Seamless integration with existing factory systems
   - Fleet coordination for multi-robot workflows
   - Digital twin technologies for simulation and planning

### Partnership Structure

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Funding | $1.8M over 3 years |
| Team | 4 PhD students, 2 postdocs, faculty advisors |
| Industrial Partners | Robotics Frontiers R&D team |
| IP Agreement | Jointly owned patents, open-source core algorithms |
| Deployment Testbed | Robotics Frontiers pilot manufacturing facility |

## Benefits to Research and Education

This partnership brings significant advantages to our academic mission:

- **Real-world validation** of research in operational manufacturing environments
- **Internship opportunities** for undergraduate and graduate students
- **Industry-relevant problems** driving fundamental research questions
- **Accelerated technology transfer** from lab to commercial applications

> "This partnership represents a perfect alignment of academic research excellence and industrial expertise. Together, we'll tackle fundamental challenges in collaborative robotics while developing solutions that can be deployed in real manufacturing settings today." â€” Prof. Michael Torres, EMBER Lab Director

## First Research Project: Adaptive Assembly

The initial project under this partnership will focus on developing a robotic system capable of assembling consumer electronics with high variability in components. This challenging task requires:

* Precise manipulation of small parts
* Adaptation to component variations
* Quality verification through visual and tactile sensing
* Learning from human demonstrations
